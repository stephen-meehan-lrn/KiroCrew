"""``GET``/``PUT /api/variables`` — read the variable cascade, or patch one scope.

``GET`` reports what this endpoint can EDIT — the pairs the variables store holds
for each scope — alongside the resolved map and where each winning value came from.

``PUT`` applies a PER-KEY patch: ``set`` names pairs to write, ``delete`` names keys
to remove. It deliberately does not replace a whole scope. The replace form drew a
data-loss finding in three consecutive review rounds, all from one root: the client
had to echo back a map it had read, so two clients replacing the same scope clobbered
each other's unrelated edits and a value the client could not see got dropped.
Touching only the named keys removes that: a key nobody named is never read, never
rewritten, and cannot be lost.

Deleting is therefore an explicit verb rather than "absence from the map", which also
keeps the empty string unambiguous — it is a legal value that still overrides a
broader scope, so it cannot share an encoding with "unset".

Validation refuses rather than drops. The loader deliberately drops a bad pair with a
warning so one hand-edited mistake cannot cost the rest of a scope or fail a load,
but a dashboard write is interactive: silently discarding a pair the user just typed
would look like a save that worked.

WHAT THIS ENDPOINT NO LONGER HAS TO DO
======================================

Variables used to live in ``config.json``, which has a ``config.local.json`` overlay
and a whole-file writer (``KiroCrewConfig.save()``). That placement, not this
endpoint, generated most of this feature's review history, and moving the data to its
own store deleted four mechanisms outright:

* the ``variables_overlay_owned`` refusal — the store has no overlay layer, so there
  is no class of key this endpoint can read but not write;
* the deleted-workspace resurrection guard — a store entry naming a workspace the
  config does not define is inert (the loader skips it) instead of materializing one;
* the malformed-workspace-entry and merged-vs-base distinction — the store holds only
  variables, so there is no neighbouring config shape to misread;
* ``save()`` interaction entirely — nothing but this endpoint writes the store.

See ``config/variables_store.py`` for why the three in-config alternatives were each
wrong. Malformed-container refusal survives the move and lives in the store, because
"do not replace a value whose shape you cannot interpret" is a property of the data,
not of where it is kept.
