    Only meaningful for a feed-checkable install (a ``cli.sh`` wheel, a cloud
    source install). A git checkout tracks a git remote and a desktop bundle or
    container is updated by something else entirely, so those layouts are
    REFUSED rather than silently writing a file nothing reads — a switcher that
    appears to work and changes nothing is worse than no switcher.

    Switching does not install anything. It changes which feed the next check
    compares against, and which ``--channel`` the recommended installer command
    spells; the user still runs that command (or clicks Update on a
    self-updatable layout). That keeps a channel change from ever being an
    unattended, unconsented version jump.

    **Not a governance bypass.** ``UpdatePins`` constrains the git ``source`` and
    a ``min_version`` floor; it has no release-channel key, so there is no pin
    for this to escape. Nor does the endpoint grant a new capability: the channel
    file is an ordinary file in the data home that the operator can already
    write. What it adds is an authenticated, allowlist-validated path to the same
    write. Introducing an enterprise channel pin is a governance change in its
    own right — the profile parser fails closed on unknown keys, so a new key has
    to be rolled out before it can be set.
