 *  items (`layout.gap`), 8px above the first and below the last
 *  (`layout.paddingTop`/`paddingBottom`, applied as margins on its item
 *  container), and a further 8px inside each item below its last code row
 *  (`itemMetrics.paddingBottom`, which defaults to `spacing`). All four are
 *  zeroed so consecutive files sit flush and the hairline below is the only
 *  separator. Note `layout` is read as `options.layout ?? DEFAULT_CODE_VIEW_LAYOUT`
 *  with NO per-key merge, so all three of its keys have to be given; `itemMetrics`
 *  does merge per key, so it names only what it changes.
 *
 *  Both are the library's declared options rather than CSS overrides, which
 *  matters: the same numbers feed the virtualizer's height estimates for items it
 *  has not rendered yet, so styling the spacing away instead would desync the
 *  scroll offsets.
 *
 *  The file header keeps Pierre's stock tone — the same canvas as the code it
 *  labels. A lighter band was tried to make each file read as a row and reverted:
 *  the hairline above each header separates them without a second competing tint.
 *
 *  `disableFileHeader` flips to false here — and that is not cosmetic. CodeView
 *  measures the header band into its own layout and pins it while the file
 *  scrolls; `getStickyHeaderOffset` returns 0 whenever the header is disabled,
 *  so `stickyHeaders` without it is a silent no-op. The single-file surfaces
 *  keep the header off because their call sites draw their own chrome, but here
 *  the header IS the row: it carries the change icon, the path, the +/- counts,
