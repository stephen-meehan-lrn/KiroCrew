/**
 * Change-set tree for the pull request panel, rendered with `@pierre/trees`.
 *
 * Unlike `PierreWorkspaceTreeImpl` this fetches nothing: a pull request's file
 * list arrives with the source payload, so the tree is a pure projection of
 * props — the changed paths, each file's change lane, the caller's viewed set
 * (drawn as a per-row check decoration), and the file currently at the top of
 * the diff viewport (echoed as the selection). Clicking a file reports its
 * repo-relative path so the caller can scroll the diff to it.
 *
 * Reached only through the lazy boundary in `./tree`, like the other trees
 * surface, so `@pierre/trees` stays out of the eager bundle.
