# Connections L1: the authorized-grant smoke rung

A visible Connect card is a promise the flow works; each rung of the launch
ladder asserts something the rung below structurally cannot:

| Rung | Where | Needs an account? | Asserts |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L0** | `connections-l0.yml`, nightly, every branch | no | the provider's PUBLIC OAuth metadata still matches the committed `l0_expectations` |
| **L1** | `connections-l1.yml`, scheduled, opt-in box | yes, one human click per provider, once | a grant that exists still works against the live endpoint |
| **L2** | manual, at the flag-flip gate | yes | the UI walk-through a human has to actually see (see the Connections manual test SOP) |

L0 never authenticates, so it cannot prove a *connection*; L2 costs a human
every time. L1 sits between: one consent click seeds a provider, then automated.

## What a green L1 run actually proves

**Kiro Crew holds no token.** kiro-cli owns the OAuth chain and injects the
bearer inside its own process ([mcp-oauth-ownership.md](mcp-oauth-ownership.md)),
so an exchange opened from the harness presents only the headers the server
entry itself carries — for a managed provider, none — and the live endpoint
answers with an OAuth challenge, exactly as it answers the dashboard's probe
(`mcp_discovery._needs_authorization`, imported rather than re-derived). The
verdict vocabulary is built around that fact:

| Verdict | Green? | Established |
|---|---|---|
| `PASS` | yes | the full chain ran: `initialize`, `tools/list`, and the registry `smoke_fixture` via `tools/call`, non-error. Reachable for an entry that carries its own credential, or an unprotected server |
| `GRANT_HELD` | yes | the grant is still on disk **and** the endpoint is reachable and still answers a well-formed challenge. Does **not** prove a tool call would succeed |
| `NEEDS_RECONSENT` | no | a credential this process presented was refused, or an authorization error came back mid-exchange. A human must re-approve |
| `FAIL` | no | reached and wrong, or unreachable: non-2xx with no challenge, 5xx, timeout, transport error, broken `tools/list`, fixture tool no longer advertised, fixture call errored |
| `SKIPPED` | yes | not a configured MCP server here, or no grant for it. **L1 never initiates consent** |

Each row also carries `depth` (`tool_call` / `tools_list` / `challenge` /
`none`), so how far the exchange got is never inferred.

### Runbook for a failing lane

| Symptom | What it means, what to do |
|---|---|
| `vacuous`, every provider `SKIPPED` | No grant is seeded, and seeding IS the one-time consent click: on the box, open Connections and click Connect per provider. Lower `--min-exercised` only if you mean "cover fewer providers" |
| `NEEDS_RECONSENT` | The grant is spent (expired refresh token, or revoked upstream). A human re-approves on the card |
| `FAIL` | Usually a provider-side change to its MCP surface: read their changelog before editing our registry |
| "exceeded its total timeout" | The provider outlasted its whole budget, not one request's. Raise `--timeout` only for a known-slow provider; otherwise treat as `FAIL` -- a session cannot get a tool out of it either |

### The decision that shaped this: a challenge is not a failure

The earlier draft graded every tokenless 401 as `NEEDS_RECONSENT` — but under
runtime token custody that is what a **healthy** authorized provider returns
every time, so the lane would sit permanently red, and a lane nobody believes
is worse than no lane. So the challenge became its own verdict and
`NEEDS_RECONSENT` narrowed to an attributable rejection. Consequence worth
naming: a tokenless `403` with no `WWW-Authenticate` grades `FAIL`, not
`NEEDS_RECONSENT` — an edge proxy or geo block reads identically, and a consent
verdict would send a human to re-approve a grant that was never at fault.

### A run that exercised nothing is not green

With no seeded grants every provider is `SKIPPED` and the aggregate would be a
cheerful `ok` establishing nothing. `--min-exercised N` (the lane passes `1`)
makes that `vacuous`, nonzero, naming the consent step. `GRANT_HELD` counts as
exercised; `SKIPPED` does not.

## Grant presence is observed, never read

`grant_key`, `grant_present` and `kiro_oauth_cache_dir` are imported from
`connections/mint.py` rather than copied — this slice's dedupe obligation,
pinned by identity in the tests (the copy that drifts grades a live connection
`SKIPPED` while the card says connected). Presence is a `stat` of the paired
`{sha256}.token.json` + `{sha256}.registration.json` artifacts and opens
neither, so no token byte can enter the process, report, or a log line; the
single-file `{sha256}.json` SSO form is deliberately not consulted, and a test
fixture makes any *open* of either artifact an outright failure. No SEL read
audit, unlike mint's `_grant_observed`: that covers a Connect flow acting for a
remote caller, whereas this is an operator's own CLI, `l0_probe`'s class.

## Known gap: raising `GRANT_HELD` to `PASS`

The gap is *who opens the exchange*: kiro-cli already holds the bearer, so the
honest fix is having the runtime run `tools/list` and the fixture call — not
reading the token store here, the boundary this module exists to respect. ACP
exposes no tool-invocation surface outside a model turn today, so this lands
with the ACP-side observation slice; until then `GRANT_HELD` is the ceiling for
runtime-custody providers.

## Running it by hand

`python3 -m kiro_crew.connections.l1_smoke --report /tmp/l1.json` (under a
pipx/venv install, use that environment's interpreter). `--min-exercised 1`
reproduces the lane's gate; `--concurrency` and `--timeout` are in `--help`.
