"""Security tests for {{variable}} expansion in the dashboard turn pipeline.

The property under test is that expansion reaches the user's OWN text and nothing
else. Two halves are needed, because either alone is weak evidence:

* Behaviour at the seam — the resolvers, the expander and the join helpers, driven
  in the order the pipeline drives them.
* A source-order guard proving the pipeline actually composes them in that order.
  Without it, these tests would only prove that a safe ordering exists, not that
  the shipped code uses it.
